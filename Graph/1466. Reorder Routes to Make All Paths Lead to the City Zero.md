There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a road from city `ai` to city `bi`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

```cpp
class Solution {

private:

    void dfs(vector<int>adj[], int src, vector<bool>&vis, int& count){

        vis[src] = true;

        for(auto x: adj[src]){

            if(!vis[abs(x)]){

                if(x > 0)

                    ++count;

                dfs(adj, abs(x), vis, count);

            }  

        }

    }

public:

    int minReorder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {

        vector<int>adj[n];
    
        //for every city store the adjacent city along with direction 
        //to store the direction we use positive indicating a road from a to b for a
        //we use negative indicating there is a road from b to a for a

        for(auto x: connections)

            adj[x[0]].push_back(x[1]), adj[x[1]].push_back(-x[0]);

        vector<bool>visited(n, false);


        //start dfs from city  0 
        //when ever you found a positive then it need to be reversed

        int count = 0;

        dfs(adj, 0, visited, count);

        return count;

    }

};
```
